We use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security on sensitive accounts such your ablehealth.com Google account.

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

If you're new to 2FA, it's a feature that adds an additional “factor” to your normal login procedure to verify your identity. 

2FA strengthens your login security by requiring something you know (a unique username and password) and something you have (a smartphone app, a hardware token, SMS passcodes to you, phone callbacks, etc.). 

2FA is paired with accounts. We required 2FA on all Able Health Google accounts and LastPass acounts.

## Why use Two-Factor authentication?

It's easy for someone to steal your password. Any of these common actions could put you at risk of having your password stolen:
- Using the same password on more than one site
- Downloading software from the Internet
- Clicking on links in email messages

With your ablehealth.com Google credentials, an untrusted source would have access to your email and any Google resource you have access to, which might include sensitive information.

Two-factor authentication is one of the best ways to protect against remote attacks such as phishing, credential exploitation and other attempts to takeover your accounts. Without your physical device (your phone), remote attackers can’t pretend to be you in order to gain unauthorized access to corporate networks, cloud storage, financial information, etc., even if they have your password.

## How does 2FA work?

Signing in to your account with 2FA works a little differently.
1. You'll enter your email and password: Whenever you sign in to Google, you'll enter your email address and password as usual.
2. You'll be asked for an additional verification code provided by an authenticator app on your phone.

Both LastPass and Google offer a feature to register your computer for 30 days when you use 2FA to sign-in. After the first login, you won't be asked for a code on that computer again until 30 days.

## Ok then. How do I start using 2FA with my Google account?

1. First, install a free authenticator app for your Android device or iPhone—this is an app that generates the time-based codes you'll using to sign in. The following are apps are available in both the Google Play and Apple App Stores.
- Google Authenticator  
- LastPass Authenticator 
- KeePass
