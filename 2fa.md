We use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security on sensitive accounts such your ablehealth.com Google account.

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

If you're new to 2FA, it's a feature that adds an additional “factor” to your normal login procedure to verify your identity. 

2FA strengthens your login security by requiring something you know (a unique username and password) and something you have (a smartphone app, a hardware token, SMS passcodes to you, phone callbacks, etc.). 

2FA is paired with accounts. We required 2FA on all Able Health Google accounts and LastPass acounts.

## Why use Two-Factor authentication?

It's easy for someone to steal your password. Any of these common actions could put you at risk of having your password stolen:
- Using the same password on more than one site
- Downloading software from the Internet
- Clicking on links in email messages

With your ablehealth.com Google credentials, an untrusted source would have access to your email and any Google resource you have access to, which might include sensitive information.

Two-factor authentication is one of the best ways to protect against remote attacks such as phishing, credential exploitation and other attempts to takeover your accounts. Without your physical device (your phone), remote attackers can’t pretend to be you in order to gain unauthorized access to corporate networks, cloud storage, financial information, etc., even if they have your password.

## How does 2FA work?

Signing in to your account with 2FA works a little differently.

1. You'll enter your email address and password as usual.
2. You'll be asked for an additional verification step which, can be either:
  - A sign-in request with a pop-up notification on your phone. 
  - A time-based, six-digit verification code provided by an authenticator app on your phone, such as Google Authenticator or LastPass Authenticator.

Both LastPass and Google offer a feature to register your computer for 30 days when you first use 2FA to sign-in. If you register your computer, you won't be asked for a code on that computer again for 30 days.

## Ok then. How do I start using 2FA with my Gmail and Google Apps account?

The easiest way to approve 2FA sign-in requests is with a single tap on your phone.

1. If you're using an iPhone, install the free [Google App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-app-search-made-just/id284815942?mt=8). Android phones have this functionality built-in.
1. [Setup 2FA for your Google account](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/)

Now, after entering your user name and password, you simply turn to your phone where a pop-up notification has appeared asking you to verify the sign-in. One tap, and you’re done.

## All well and good. Now, how do I start using 2FA with my LastPass account?

LastPass also supports one-tap 2FA by using the LastPass Authenticator app available in the Google Play and Apple App Store.

1. First, install the LastPass authenticator app for your [Android device](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.authenticator) or [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lastpass-authenticator/id1079110004).
2. [Pair the LastPass Authenticator app with your LastPass account](https://helpdesk.lastpass.com/multifactor-authentication-options/lastpass-authenticator/)
