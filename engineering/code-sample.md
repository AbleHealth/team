# Able Health Hiring Assignments

The goal of the Able Health coding request is to help us obtain some understanding about your coding style and approach, as well as to see something technical you are proud of.   It helps us in evaluating your technical skills as it applies to the typical projects we do.  Most of our current work is done in some combination of Ruby and Ruby-on-Rails and the typical associated technologies like Javascript and databases.  

Please ensure that the quality of work you submit is consistent with how you'd like to be viewed.

### Please Keep in Mind 

- The work should be primarily your creation.  It's okay if you point us to some open source project you contributed to, but we want to evaluate your work, not others'.  If this is what you do, give us a commit/branch SHA on github or similar that isolates your work from others.
- You must be free to share the work with us. We don't want to see things for which you or we don't have license to see the IP.
- It should be in a language/platform that is relevant to what we do.  We also have familiarity with Python/Django, Go, nodejs, etc.
- It helps if it is a substantial piece of work, or something that demonstrated your ability over a sustained pace of time.
