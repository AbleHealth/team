# Able Health Coding Requests

The goal of the Able Health coding request is to help us obtain some understanding about your coding style and approach, as well as to see something technical you are proud of.   It helps us when thinking about your technical skills as it applies to the typical projects we do.  Most of our current work is done in some combination of Ruby, Ruby-on-Rails, and commonly used technologies like Javascript and PostgreSQL as it applies to the full technology stack.

Please ensure that the quality of work you submit is consistent with how you'd like to be viewed.

### Please Keep in Mind 

- The work should be primarily your creation.  It's great if you point us to some open source project you contributed to, and ideally we want to evaluate your coding in regards something you've had time to work on.
- You must be free to share the work with us. We don't want to see things for which you or we don't have license to see the IP.
- It should be in a language/platform that is relevant to what we do.  We also have familiarity with Python/Django, PHP, Java, Go, nodejs, etc.  Please ask if you are not sure. 
- It is helpful if it is something larger that demonstrates your approach over a sustained period of time.
- Last but not least, thank you.
