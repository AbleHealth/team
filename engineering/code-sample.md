# Able Health Hiring Assignments

The goal of the Able Health coding assignment is for you to demonstrate to us that you
have the technical skills that we need on the typical projects we do.  Most of
our current work is done in some combination of Ruby/Rails-based web work
(including Javascript and associated client side frameworks)
We want you to use this opportunity to impress us - either with some prior work
you've done or by taking on a new assignment and completing it with skill
relatively quickly.

Here's a brief comparison between junior and senior level expectations:

- *Junior Engineer* - still learning some technical skills that we
  use every day. You are still expected to to be capable of researching topics
  an applying them, but you won't be as proficient in development as people
  with more experience.
- *Senior Engineer* - not only are you a fast worker who knows their
  tools backward and forward, you also have gained wisdom through experience
  and this shows in your work.  If you're a developer, your code follows
  well-established principles (e.g. SOLID), is easy to maintain, and
  demonstrates maturity in your approach.  

Although your coding assignment should offer us some insight into where you
fall on this spectrum, it is not the only (or even primary) way we'll make
that determination.  Still, ensure that the quality of work you do as part of this
assignment is consistent with how you'd like to be viewed.

## Please Ensure

- The work should be primarily your creation.  It's okay if you point us to some open source project you contributed to, but we want to evaluate your work, not others'.  If this is what you do, give us a commit/branch SHA on github or similar that isolates your work from others.
- You must be free to share the work with us. We don't want to see things for which you or we don't have license to see the IP.
- It should be in a language/platform that is relevant to what we do. Some contenders: Ruby/Rails, Python/Django, Go, nodejs, etc.
- It should be a substantial piece of work.  This option is designed for you to impress us on something that demonstrates your ability to work over a sustained piece of time.
